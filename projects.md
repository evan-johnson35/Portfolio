# Campus Involvement

<ul>
  <li><b>International Business Club - Social Chair</b>: Assist in organizing and promoting events with students where we have speakers or teacher talk to on a specified topic.</li>
  <li><b>Pi Kappa Phi - Social Chair</b>: Organize events with other greek life organizations on campus. I help coordinate with venues and transportation services for these events. Other events I help with include philanthropy events and our "formal," where we spend a weekend in Aspen or Telluride. </li>
  <li><b>Hacky Sack Club - member</b>: My roommates and I love to hacky to clear our heads from school, so one of my roommates started a club at DU where we have hacky tournaments each quarter. </li>
